# 8kLisp

Alexander Burger. 8kLisp. CP/M program, circa 1986-1987.

From the [Computer History Museum][]'s [Software Preservation Group][] archive, [8kLisp][8kLisp. CP/M program, circa 1986-1987].

> The last version of the immediate predecessor of PicoLisp, an 8bit version for Z80 called 8kLisp. The filestamps are preserved from when the files where copied from CP/M (1986 and 1987, CP/M didn't have such meta data), and the explicit dates in the sources are from March 1986 through June 1987.[^1]

The version from the archive is missing the *if, when,* and *unless* functions, and has an undocumented *do* function.
